        "\n",
        "At the most basic level, functions do something to some inputs you give them. For example, say I took 10 different measurements with a CosmicWatch and I wanted to determine the duration of each measurement from the dataset. One option I could go with is to write the code to calculate the length of the dataset 10 times. This is a lot of repeated work. Instead, I can define a function to determine the duration of a dataset. Now, whenever I want to calculate the duration of a dataset, I can just call the function, without needing to write more code.\n",
